Okay, I need to convert the COBOL program ABH004 into a Java class. Let me start by understanding what the COBOL program does. From the description, it calculates the total number of days between two dates, considering leap years and varying month lengths. 

First, I'll look at the business rules. The program validates the input date format, calculates leap years, sums days for each month, and adjusts for leap years if the date is after February. It uses arrays for month days and loops through years and months.

Now, thinking about how to translate this into Java. I know Java has robust date handling with the java.time package, but since the COBOL program seems to handle dates manually, maybe I should follow a similar approach for accuracy.

I'll create a class called DateCalculator. It should have a method calculateDays that takes a String date in YYYYMMDD format and returns the total days as an integer.

I'll need to parse the input string into day, month, and year components. In COBOL, they used redefinition, but in Java, I'll split the string into integers.

Next, I'll handle leap year calculation. The COBOL program loops through each year to count leap years. I'll write a helper method isLeapYear that checks if a given year is a leap year based on the rules: divisible by 400 or by 4 but not 100.

Then, I'll create an array for the number of days in each month, similar to WA-M-ARR. I'll sum the days up to the given month. If the year is a leap year and the month is after February, I'll add an extra day.

I'll structure the calculateDays method to compute the total days by combining days from full years, leap days, months, and the current day. I'll make sure to handle the leap year adjustment correctly.

I should also include error handling, but since the COBOL program expects valid input, I'll assume the input is correct for now.

Putting it all together, I'll write the Java class with the necessary methods and ensure it follows modern Java practices, using clear variable names and proper structure.

Here's the Java class that converts the COBOL program ABH004 into a well-structured Java solution:

```json
{
    "file_name": "DateCalculator",
    "package": "com.company.module",
    "content": "package com.company.module;\n\npublic class DateCalculator {\n    private static final int[] DAYS_IN_MONTH = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};\n\n    public int calculateDays(String dateString) {\n        int year = Integer.parseInt(dateString.substring(0, 4));\n        int month = Integer.parseInt(dateString.substring(4, 6));\n        int day = Integer.parseInt(dateString.substring(6, 8));\n\n        int totalDays = 0;\n        int leapYears = countLeapYears(year);\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < month - 1; i++) {\n            totalDays += DAYS_IN_MONTH[i];\n        }\n\n        if (isLeapYear(year) && month > 2) {\n            totalDays += 1;\n        }\n\n        totalDays += day;\n\n        return totalDays;\n    }\n\n    private int countLeapYears(int year) {\n        int count = 0;\n        for (int y = 1901; y <= year; y++) {\n            if (isLeapYear(y)) {\n                count++;\n            }\n        }\n        return count;\n    }\n\n    private boolean isLeapYear(int year) {\n        return year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0);\n    }\n}",
    "description": "A Java class that calculates the total number of days from a given date, considering leap years and varying month lengths."
}
```

This Java class encapsulates the functionality of the COBOL program, providing a clean and efficient solution for calculating days between dates.
